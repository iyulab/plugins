# Development Phase Runner

Execute development tasks based on roadmap or input.

## Philosophy

**"Roadmap-driven, philosophy-aligned"** - Trace changes to planned work, align with project principles.

**"Root cause over symptom"** - No surface fixes. Solve underlying problems.

**"No tech debt"** - Complete implementations only. Partial = forgotten.

**"Bold refactoring"** - Fix inefficiency now. Propose large refactors as next phase if scope exceeds.

## Integration: Claude & Official Plugins

iyu:run **leverages** Claude's capabilities and official plugins:

| Situation | Leverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Bug discovered | `/iyu:issue` framework for root cause analysis |
| Code writing | Claude's native ability (no extra instructions needed) |
| Code review needed | `feature-dev:code-reviewer` agent available |
| Commit | `/commit` or built-in commit phase |
| PR creation | `/commit-push-pr` available |

## Input Modes

### Mode A: No Input (Roadmap-Driven)
```bash
/iyu:run
```
1. Scan ROADMAP.md for next pending phase
2. If no pending phases → EXIT "All phases complete"
3. Extract tasks from phase scope
4. Execute full workflow

### Mode B: With Input (Input-Driven)
```bash
/iyu:run "Add caching layer to API endpoints"
/iyu:run "Fix memory leak in worker threads"
```
1. Parse input as task description
2. Derive scope and tasks
3. Check philosophy alignment
4. Execute full workflow

**Flags**:
- `--dry-run`: Plan only, no execution
- `--no-commit`: Execute but skip commit

## Process

### Phase 1: Roadmap Scan

```
Check ROADMAP.md or docs/roadmap.md
Phase status: [ ] pending, [x] done, [~] in-progress
```

**Output**:
```
ROADMAP: [file path]
Next Phase: [phase name]
Status: [READY / BLOCKED / NONE_PENDING]
```

- **NONE_PENDING**: All phases complete → EXIT
- **BLOCKED**: Dependency not met → EXIT

### Phase 2: Task Extraction

Break phase scope into concrete tasks:

1. Derive implementation tasks
2. Research unfamiliar territory with WebSearch
3. Identify task dependencies
4. Estimate complexity (S/M/L)

**Research Triggers** (auto):
- New technology/pattern not in codebase
- Mentions "best practice", "modern", "latest"
- External integration required
- Security/performance critical

### Phase 3: Philosophy Alignment

Evaluate each task against CLAUDE.md:

| Dimension | Score 1-5 |
|-----------|-----------|
| Core Mission Fit | Serves core purpose? |
| Scope Boundaries | Within scope? |
| Architecture Patterns | Consistent with patterns? |
| Naming/Style | Follows conventions? |

**Decision Matrix**:
```
             | Scope IN        | Scope OUT       |
-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
Mission HIGH | PROCEED         | ADAPT           |
Mission MED  | ADAPT           | PARTIAL         |
Mission LOW  | PARTIAL         | REJECT          |
```

- **PROCEED**: Execute all tasks
- **ADAPT**: Execute with adjustments
- **PARTIAL**: Execute some, exclude others
- **REJECT**: EXIT - Philosophy violation

### Phase 4: Planning

```
EXECUTION PLAN
- Phase: [name]
- Tasks: [N]
- Files: [M files to modify/create]

TASKS
1. [task] - [deliverables] - [criteria]
2. [task] - [deliverables] - [criteria]

RISKS
- [risk]: [mitigation]
```

**If --dry-run, stop here**

### Phase 5: Execution

**Track progress with TodoWrite** (required)

Per-task loop:
1. Execute task
2. Test after changes
3. Mark complete

**Root Cause Mindset** (apply during execution):
- Problem encountered? → Ask "why" 5 times
- Tempted by quick fix? → Resist. Find root cause.
- Pattern detected? → Check elsewhere with Grep/Glob
- Tech debt spotted? → Fix now or register immediate follow-up

**When bug discovered**:
1. Pause current task
2. Apply `/iyu:issue` root cause analysis framework:
   - Symptom isolation
   - Hypothesis generation
   - Evidence gathering
   - Similar pattern detection
3. Fix **all instances**, not just the trigger
4. Resume task

### Phase 6: Critical Review

Verify implementation quality:

```
REVIEW
- Tasks: [N/M completed]
- Tests: [All passing / N failures]
- Build: [Success / Failure]

CRITERIA CHECK
- [task 1]: [MET / PARTIAL / NOT MET]
- [task 2]: [MET / PARTIAL / NOT MET]

ISSUES FOUND
- [issue]: [severity] - [fix needed]

TECH DEBT AUDIT
- [item]: [FIXED / DEFERRED to Phase X]

REFACTORING PROPOSALS (if scope exceeded)
- [proposal]: [scope] - [suggested phase]
```

- **NEEDS_FIXES**: Return to Execution for fixes
- **REWORK_REQUIRED**: Reassess plan

### Phase 7: Cleanup

1. **Documentation**: Update README, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP
2. **Code Hygiene**: Remove debug code, unused imports
3. **Consolidation**: Clean up duplicate documentation

### Phase 8: Commit

**Version Rules**:
- **NEVER bump MAJOR** - Breaking changes require explicit user decision
- **MINOR**: New feature, major enhancement
- **PATCH**: Bug fix, small improvement

```
COMMIT
- Files: [N staged]
- Version: [None / MINOR / PATCH]
- Message: [type]: [description]
```

**Or** use `/commit` plugin.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Auto-execute next roadmap phase
/iyu:run

# Execute specific task
/iyu:run "Implement user authentication with JWT"

# Plan only (no execution)
/iyu:run --dry-run

# Execute without commit
/iyu:run --no-commit
```

## Error Handling

- **No roadmap + no input**: EXIT - nothing to do
- **No pending phases**: EXIT - all complete
- **Task failure**: Log, attempt recovery, report if unresolvable
- **Test failure**: Block commit, require fix
